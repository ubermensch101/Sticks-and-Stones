# Sticks-and-Stones
There are 4 objects/characters in the game:
1.	Hero: 
You can move him up, left, down and right using the keys WASD respectively. His objective is to destroy the 8 cannons by poking them with his stick while best trying to dodge the stones. He moves continuosly once the WASD key is pressed and stops when any other key is pressed (the use of the space bar is recommended to stop the hero). He has 3 health points—if he's hit 3 times, you lose the game.
2.	Cannons:
They fire stones at somewhat regular intervals in a particular direction and they die when they are hit with the hero’s stick.
3.	Stones:
Each stone reduces the hero’s health by one on impact after which it disappears.
4.	Walls:
They obstruct the hero’s movement around the map.

Objective: To navigate the hero around the map and destroy the 8 cannons with his stick.

Levels: The user is asked to input a level between 1 and 300 before the start of each game.
